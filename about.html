            <h1 class="about-section__header">How It All Began</h1>
            <h2 class="about-section__sub-header">The Myth</h2>
            <p class="about-section__paragraph">The Colorado Art Rock Society was founded 
                on March 12, 1999 by Phil Satterley and Alan Mallery. While waiting 
                in line to see a Yes concert, Alan noticed Phil leafing through a 
                copy of Paramhansa Yoganada's Autobiography of a Yogi. Phil was 
                caught up in a footnote on page 92 that described a secret society 
                of music lovers who only listen to music in odd meters.
            </p>
            <p class="about-section__paragraph">After the show, Alan followed Phil back 
                to his house where the two of them began holding sessions by 
                candlelight. The concept came together during one 6-hour session 
                which carried on until 7a.m. They had listened to Van Der Graaf 
                Generator's entire back catalog. It was a magical experience that 
                left both of them exhilarated for days. They both agreed that 
                there was only one course of action and that was to form a music
                society for like minded and intelligent odd-metered music 
                connoisseurs, The Colorado Art Rock Society.</p>

            <h2 class="about-section__sub-header">A Note From Phil...
            </h2>
            <p class="about-section__paragraph">The Colorado Art Rock Society (C.A.R.S.) 
                was formed in 1999 when Phil Satterley had a chance meeting with 
                Alan and Carrie Mallery at the Bajaprog '99 Festival in Mexicali, 
                Mexico (surprisingly the first people Phil even talked to after 
                arriving in Mexico were also from Colorado!) The first meeting 
                was on March 27,1999 when C.A.R.S. met at the Margarita Bay Club 
                in Denver Colorado. With just 4 members at that meeting C.A.R.S. 
                was born. Suddenly the numbers grew and after reaching over 15, 
                C.A.R.S. moved out of the smaller back meeting room and was 
                forced to take over the entire upstairs until December 29, 2001 
                when the club closed and the group moved to it's second location 
                at the Morrison Inn in Golden Colorado (actually just down the 
                street from the famed Red Rocks Amphiteater).
            </p>
            <p class="about-section__paragraph">The group met there as the numbers 
                grew and so did the noise level! The tiled floors and high 
                ceilings made it quite difficult to hear the music, let alone 
                hear each other! Finally it was decided to move. Our next 
                location was the Yummy Yummy Thai restaurant on October 25, 2003 
                and the C.A.R.S. holiday party on December 13th. It was decided 
                once again to move because of space issues and belly dancers?!?!?! 
                and it was off to the Breckenridge Brew Pub (right next to the 
                famed Coors Baseball field in Denver) where we are now. The 
                space is the right size, it's a closed off meeting area as well 
                as being perfect for listening to music as well as setting up 
                a wide screen projector for watching Prog videos!

            <p class="about-section__paragraph">The last Saturday evening of each month 
                is spent eating, drinking, making new friends as well as 
                indulging in heavy doses of Progressive Rock conversations, 
                listening and CD swapping. Membership has grown from a mere 4 
                people at the first meeting to over 130 members on the C.A.R.S. 
                mailing list and keeps growing! Other events included hosting 
                concerts like the Flower Kings on March 11, 2006 and again on 
                October 19, 2006 and helping spread the word about local concerts 
                (Porcupine Tree & Marillion) and holding our annual "Colorado Prog 
                Jam" which was first held on April 26, 2003 where the musical 
                members of our group get a chance to play "all of the Prog Songs 
                they ever wanted to play in a band but were afraid to ask". 
                On March 27, 2021, C.A.R.S. celebrated their 21st year and 
                things are looking great for the future! 
                Prog On!
